# This software is something that I have developed on my free time. Its purpose 
# is mainly to help me manage my own servers in an efficient way.

# The software is free of charge and you may copy it and redistribute it in

# Coding style
o Spaces not tabs
o A line should never be longer then 100 chars
o {} embracing are not padded (if {foo} not if { foo })
o No one-line if's or procedures

# Defined bad return values (1-10 is reserved by the framework)
2 - Fatal wrapper trigger
